## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`local storage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project served as a pivotal achievement in fortifying my proficiency in React, JavaScript, Sass, and the end-to-end Full-stack development process, significantly enhancing my skills and expertise in these technologies.

### Continued development

- I still need to work on the styles for dark mode and form validation.
- In the future, I would also like to add a drag-and-drop feature.
- Will review the code to clean it up and add extra comments for future development.
